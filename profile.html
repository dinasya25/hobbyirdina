                        My passion for singing starts when I was 11 years old. At the time, my teacher noticed my voice and encouraged me to join the school's Nasyeed team. I was unsure whether to give it a try. To my surprise, I was chosen as the team's lead vocalist. After graduating, singing became a personal escape for me and it became a hobby of mine. Karaoke became my go-to space, where I could sing my heart out without feeling judged or disturbing anyone.

                                    <li>• The pricing is very affordable with the smallest room starting at around RM 19 per hour.</li>

                        Overall, I would rate their service and pricing a solid 9 out of 10. I especially love the interior design of the karaoke space. If I were to create my own karaoke store, I would definitely use Alibaba’s layout as inspiration.

                        Even though I've always had a passion for singing, I haven't had the free time to go to karaoke often, especially when thinking about the cost. The first time I went to karaoke with friends was when I was 16. We went to a place called Diva Karaoke at One Utama.

                                <li>• The location is very strategic because the karaoke is located in one of the most popular mall in KL which is One Utama.</li>
                                <li>• The karaoke store had a vibrant, lounge-like vibe with neon lights, dim lighting, and cozy sofas that made it feel really inviting.</li>
                                <li>• The VIP karaoke room is equipped with a private toilet, providing added convenience for customers by eliminating the need to leave the room to find restroom facilities.</li>

                        To sum it all up, I would rate my experience at this karaoke a 5 out of 10. There were things I liked, but also some areas that could be improved. That doesn't mean I dislike the place because there's definitely potential. I just hope they take customer feedback seriously and work on improving their services and other aspects that need attention.

                        I recently visited Safari KBOX, a karaoke venue that left quite an impression. This time, I went with my coursemates to reward ourselves after a hectic month filled with assignments. What surprised me most was the size of the place because it's located outside of a shopping mall, which is uncommon, and it's impressively spacious for a karaoke outlet.

                                <li>• The venue offers its own designated parking spots, making it more accessible for customers who come specifically to karaoke without needing to enter a mall.</li>
                                <li>• The pricing is fair because it's affordable enough for students but not so cheap that it raises doubts about quality. The customer service was decent and added to the overall experience.</li>
                                <li>• Unlike most karaoke centers that are confined to a single floor, Safari KBOX spans two floors, which gives it a more open and organized layout.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>• For travelers or customers carrying large bags, the upstairs rooms can be inconvenient. In my case, the cashier offered to watch over our belongings at the counter, but that didn't feel secure. A locker system or secure storage area would be much more reassuring.</li>
                                <li>• One major drawback is the poor sound insulation. While waiting at the reception area, we could clearly hear people singing in multiple rooms as if we were inside the rooms with them. This might disrupt the experience for those who prefer a more private or immersive session.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        Overall, Safari KBOX shows a lot of potential, especially given its strategic location in the heart of Melaka, close to tourist hotspots like Mahkota Parade and Dataran Pahlawan. However, for it to truly thrive especially in a tourist-heavy area, it needs serious improvement. Addressing the soundproofing issue and offering secure baggage storage would significantly enhance the customer experience. With those upgrades, this venue could easily become a go-to entertainment spot for both locals and visitors.
